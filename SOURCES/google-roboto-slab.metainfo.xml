    <p>
      Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
      largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
      curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid
      rhythm, Roboto doesn't compromise, allowing letters to be settled into
      their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more
      commonly found in humanist and serif types.

    <p>
      This is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal
      Roboto family and the Roboto Condensed family.
